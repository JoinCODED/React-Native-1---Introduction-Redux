Let's set up our cookie store.

1. Create a file called `cookieStore.js` in `stores`.

2. Copy the `cookieStore` from your ReactJS web app.

3. Now what are the methods that we need? We're not gonna create, update or delete any cookies here. So remove all those methods. We only need the `fetchCookies` and `getCookieById` methods.

4. We'll need both `cookies` and `loading` properties so keep them.
