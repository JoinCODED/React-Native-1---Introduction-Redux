1. Inside your `Development` directory, create your first `React Native` project:

   ```shell
   $ expo-cli init cookie-shop
   ```

2. You can choose a blank project or a template, for now we will choose an empty template as shown below:

   By default, expo will use yarn to install all the files.

Your application is now ready!

3. As you can see `expo` is telling you how to run the application.

4. `cd` into your project and open it in VSCode, and let's get to work!
