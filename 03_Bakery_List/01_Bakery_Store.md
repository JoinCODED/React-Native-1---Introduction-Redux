Let's start with setting up our bakery store.

1. Install `mobx`, `mobx-react` and `axios`.

   ```shell
   $ yarn add mobx mobx-react axios
   ```

2. Create a folder called `stores`.

3. Create a file called `bakeryStore.js`.

4. There's no need to create a store from scratch. Copy the one from your ReactJS web app.

5. We'll need both `bakeries` and `loading` so keep them.

6. Copy the `instance.js` file as well from your ReactJS web app.
